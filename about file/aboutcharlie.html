   <p>Charlie Chaplin was born on <strong>April 16, 1889</strong>, in London, England. He grew up very poor, and his childhood was difficult. His father left when he was young, and his mother struggled with mental illness. He spent time in workhouses and on the streets.</p>

<p>Despite these hardships, Charlie showed talent for performing at a young age. He joined a theater group as a child and later started working in comedy and music hall acts. This helped him learn the timing and style that made him famous later on.</p>

<p>In 1913, he moved to the United States and began working in silent films. He quickly became famous for his character "The Tramp" — a man in a bowler hat, mustache, and baggy pants who tried to stay kind and hopeful in a tough world.</p>

<p>Chaplin was a master of both comedy and emotion. His movies were funny, but they also showed sadness, poverty, and kindness. Some of his most famous films include <em>The Kid</em>, <em>City Lights</em>, <em>Modern Times</em>, and <em>The Great Dictator</em>.</p>

<p>He was not only an actor, but also a writer, director, composer, and producer. He worked on every part of his films and even created the music for many of them. He was known for being a perfectionist and working very hard.</p>

<p>Chaplin’s career faced trouble in the 1940s and 1950s when he was accused of having political views that some people thought were too left-wing. He was even banned from returning to the U.S. for a time, and he moved to Switzerland with his family.</p>

<p>In 1972, the U.S. welcomed him back and gave him an honorary Oscar for his lifetime of work in film. He received a long standing ovation that showed how much people still loved and respected him.</p>

<p>Charlie Chaplin died on <strong>December 25, 1977</strong>, at the age of 88. He is remembered as one of the most important and beloved figures in movie history, and his influence can still be seen in films today.</p>
