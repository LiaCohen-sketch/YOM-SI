       <p>Humphrey Bogart was born on <strong>December 25, 1899</strong>, in New York City. His father was a doctor and his mother was a commercial artist. He grew up in a wealthy family and went to private schools, but he didnâ€™t enjoy school and was later expelled.</p>

<p>During World War I, Bogart joined the U.S. Navy. After the war, he worked different jobs, including in theater, where he began acting. He started on Broadway and later moved to Hollywood in the 1930s to work in films.</p>

<p>At first, Bogart was cast in small roles, often playing gangsters or bad guys. His big break came in 1941 when he starred in the movie <em>High Sierra</em>, followed by <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. These films made him a major star.</p>

<p>In 1942, Bogart played the role of Rick Blaine in <em>Casablanca</em>, which became one of the most famous movies of all time. His tough-guy style and deep voice became his trademark. He continued to star in hit films like <em>To Have and Have Not</em>, <em>The Big Sleep</em>, and <em>Key Largo</em>.</p>

<p>He was married four times, but his most famous relationship was with actress <strong>Lauren Bacall</strong>. They met while filming <em>To Have and Have Not</em> and married in 1945. The couple starred in several movies together and had two children.</p>

<p>Bogart was known for playing strong, serious characters, but in real life he had a good sense of humor and was respected by other actors. He was also part of the "Rat Pack," a group of popular entertainers.</p>

<p>In 1951, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in <em>The African Queen</em>. This showed that he could play more than just tough guys and was truly a talented actor.</p>

<p>Sadly, Humphrey Bogart died of cancer on <strong>January 14, 1957</strong>, at the age of 57. His work left a strong impact on Hollywood, and he is still remembered today as one of the greatest film actors of all time.</p>
