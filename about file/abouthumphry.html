       <p>Marilyn Monroe was born as <strong>Norma Jeane Mortenson</strong> on <strong>June 1, 1926</strong>, in Los Angeles, California. Her childhood was hard. Her mother had mental health problems, and Marilyn never knew her father. She lived in many foster homes and even stayed in an orphanage.</p>

<p>At age 16, she married a man named James Dougherty to avoid returning to the orphanage. During World War II, she worked in a factory, where a photographer discovered her. That started her modeling career, which later led to acting.</p>

<p>In the late 1940s, she got a contract with <strong>20th Century Fox</strong> and began getting small movie roles. By the early 1950s, she became a huge star in Hollywood, with movies like <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em>, <em>How to Marry a Millionaire</em>, and <em>The Seven Year Itch</em>. She became known for her blonde hair, beauty, and charm.</p>

<p>Even though she played "dumb blonde" characters, Marilyn was actually smart and wanted to be taken seriously. She worked hard on her acting and even started her own production company.</p>

<p>She was married three times â€“ to James Dougherty, baseball player <strong>Joe DiMaggio</strong>, and writer <strong>Arthur Miller</strong>. All the marriages ended in divorce, but DiMaggio stayed close to her for many years.</p>

<p>Marilyn had a difficult personal life. She struggled with sadness, anxiety, and pressure from fame. She also had problems with sleep and took a lot of pills to try to cope.</p>

<p>On <strong>August 5, 1962</strong>, Marilyn Monroe died at age 36 from an overdose of sleeping pills. Many people believe it was a suicide, but others still wonder if there was more to the story.</p>

<p>Even though she died young, Marilyn Monroe is still one of the most famous movie stars ever. She is remembered for her beauty, talent, and the sadness behind her smile.</p>
